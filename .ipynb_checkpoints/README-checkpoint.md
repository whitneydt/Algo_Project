# Proposal
Pull sentiment and price action from the 2008 Recession as well as the past five years to determine what companies would be best to select for a projection along with advice on when to hedge or deploy capital. After narrowing down the favorable sectors, we will select up to 2 companies from each of these sectors to assess the weight they should have in some of our portfolios. After collecting enough portfolios with different weights for each of the preferred sectors, present the data for the trading dashboard. If there’s enough time, we’ll utilize a robo advisor that will offer advice from fundamental analysis and sentiment, instead of the majority of our portfolio decisions coming from technical analysis.
